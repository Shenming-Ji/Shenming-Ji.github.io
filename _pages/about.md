I'm Shenming, a third-year undergraduate student at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), majoring in Information and Computing Science:computer:. 
  
My interests mainly focus on Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, and Social Computing. As an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, I am deeply passionate about exploration and pushing the boundaries of knowledge. I am dedicated to exploring diverse interdisciplinary fields, driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate.

I'm very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Teng Ma](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/TengMa) in Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships from [Department of Computing](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/organisations/department-of-computing), Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. In the summer of 2024, I fortunately will be a visiting research intern in [Dream Lab](https://www.xiameng.org/DreamLab/) at [TAMU](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html), under the guidance of [Prof. Meng Xia](https://www.xiameng.org/).
