I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, majoring in Information and Computing Science ðŸ’».

My interests primarily lie in Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, and Social Computing. As a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science, I am deeply passionate about exploring and advancing knowledge across interdisciplinary fields. Curiosity and a drive for innovation continue to fuel my academic journey ðŸŒŸ.

I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Teng Ma](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/TengMa) during the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Additionally, I spent the past summer as a visiting research intern in the [Dream Lab](https://www.xiameng.org/DreamLab/) at Texas A&M University, under the guidance of [Prof. Meng Xia](https://www.xiameng.org/).

You can find my CV [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
