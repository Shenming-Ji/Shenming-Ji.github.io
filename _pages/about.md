Hi! I'm Shenming, a third year undergraduate student from [School of Advanced Technology](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-advanced-technology), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en). My research interest includes computer graphics, machine learning, and social computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Teng Ma](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/TengMa) in Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships from [Department of Computing](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/organisations/department-of-computing), Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.
